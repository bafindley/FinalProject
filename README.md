This project aims to use Machine Learning to analyze different inputs of data to predict the gross profit for a given movie. For example, if these actors were to be cast in a genre of movie by Studio XYZ with this budget, what is the expected earnings at the box office?

Methods include: multine regression analysis, decision tree analysis, and random forest analysis using the SciKit library. 

Data was collected from Kaggle for a Machine Learning competition. The link can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction/
